        <p>Welcome! I'm a PhD candidate in computer science at Cornell University, and I'm <b>rethinking how computational thinking is taught</b>. More specifically, I am developing an adaptive learning system that teaches problem-solving skills by having students program a robot. I'm interested in how the system can spark intrinsic motivation in students, support their mastery of computational concepts, increase their scientific and technological self-efficacy, and challenge them at an appropriate level. I evaluate my system in real-world settings, with the ultimate goal of optimizing it for learners in both classrooms and online courses.</p>
        <p>Outside of my research, I also have the privilege of being a computer science instructor. Locally, I co-facilitate a <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> program where I get to share stories about inspiring women in technology and coach aspiring women in technology. Globally, I teach Python, JavaScript, and more to <a href="https://junilearning.com/" target="_blank">Juni Learning</a> students who always brighten my day.</p>
        <p>If you would like to contact either me or my dog, we can be reached via courier pigeon at <span>jproft<span aria-label="at"></span>cs.cornell.edu</span>.</p>
