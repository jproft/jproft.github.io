        <h1>Hi, I'm Julia Proft!</h1>
        <p>
          I build technology to support educators so that they can bring their
          best selves to the crucial work that they do. Great education is not
          possible without great educators: people who leave their mark on the
          world by empowering others to learn, grow, and discover who they want
          to be. Given that the work of an educator is as difficult as it is
          important, I focus my own work as a software engineer on addressing
          educator needs. In doing so, I hope to enable educators to reach more
          people and change more lives.
